# cybernewbie

This is a repository of resources for anyone who is new to and wants to learn about cyber security. It is focused on skills/tools that could be useful for participating in [CTF's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)).


## Some ideas of where to start

Depending on what you'd like to dive into there are a bunch of resources. All of the following are a good place to start for newbies: 

* [OverTheWire wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) This resource starts from learning basic linux commands in the first game Bandit, and then builds from that into different security topics.
* [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) A bunch of tutorials in the form of "rooms" of different topics, with detailed walkthroughs. Varying difficulties available. 
* [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) A portal with CTF challenges for cyber security education, very beginner-friendly with hints etc.
